# CalculateThis
Calculator. This is a work in progress. At present, I have the program as console-only but I'm trying to add a GUI.

Edits:

- Added decimalFormat so that whole numbers are displayed as whole numbers, and fractions are displayed as decimals.

- By accident, this also took care of the dividing by zero exception (which already existed, but it crashed the program)
  When the user tries to divide by zero, the output is "?" and the option to restart the program appears.

- Removed unnecessary libraries, added option to restart program.
