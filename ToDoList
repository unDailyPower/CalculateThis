Make exception for non-number into a loop, so that the program doesn't restart as a result of a non-number being entered.

Add GUI.

Add exception/error response if user enters a non-number (letter, special character, etc.)

Add GUI. Still trying to wrap my head aroung Swing/JFrame/JButton.

Add exception for dividing by zero

Add exception/error response if user enters a non-number (letter, special character, etc.)

Add output of sum as a decimal instead of a whole number
I assume using "double" instead of "int" but I don't want the user input to show up as a decimal 
(i.e. when user enters "2", it shows up as "2.0", which is what I don't want)

Add GUI. Still trying to wrap my head aroung Swing/JFrame/JButton.

Add a "C" function to clear or reset the program. 
From what I've read & researched, this isn't possible within Eclipse's console,
and I'll have to resort to add "\n" multiple times in order to make it seem like the console was cleared.
